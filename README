timeto-
write the README. Ha!

If you're here, you're on your own for now.

TODO
====
Checkout-and-run problems:
 * whines about missing cpan modules
 * whines about missing sqlite db file
  * DBIx::Class::Schema::resultset(): Can't find source for Timespan at lib/TimeTo/Table.pm line 26
 * whines that db is empty if first call is not switch
  * Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at ./timeto line 118.
    Can't call method "strftime" on an undefined value at ./timeto line 118.
 * Then it works, at least from timeto dir.
